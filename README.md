# LeetCode-Work

This repository will serve as a directory for my LeetCode Work.  My goal is to continue working on algorithms and data structures at a 2 per day pace to make
sure I stay sharp and ready for interviews.  While I recognize the coding interview is important, I look back at the projects I completed and look forward
to updating them with the frameworks I learned later in my course.

# Updates
