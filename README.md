# LeetCode-Work

This repository will serve as a directory for my LeetCode Work.  My goal is to continue working on algorithms and data structures at a 2 per day pace to make
sure I stay sharp and ready for interviews.  While I recognize the coding interview is important, I look back at the projects I completed and look forward
to updating them with the frameworks I learned later in my course.

# Updates

12-16-2022 -- Pushing most of the code I have completed so far.

12-25-2022 -- I've decided for brevity to include a combination of Leetcode, HackerRank, and CodingBat challenges here.  They're mixed and I didn't document them by number so others could just pop into my solutions -- it's too tempting for others to simply look at how other people did it.  They are titled by the function
trying to be soved.  It's been fun and at times, difficult.

Additionally, I've just set them up to be static methods that way I could create a single test case within a static main -- I've seen others work the solution class from leetcode and run JUNIT testing on it.  I think my way is more straightforward -- did this pass a test case.
